## Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis
# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict handwritten digits from images. This project uses the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark in the field of machine learning, to train and evaluate the model.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. It is widely used for tasks related to image classification.

# Project Structure
The project follows these key steps:

- Data Preparation: The MNIST dataset is loaded, and the images are reshaped and preprocessed.

- Data Visualization: A selection of sample images from the dataset is visualized for exploration.

- Data Preprocessing: Pixel values of the images are normalized to a range of [0, 1].

- Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X): The target variable represents the actual digit labels, and the feature variables represent the pixel data of the images.

- Train Test Split: The data is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

- Modeling: A Random Forest Classifier is built and trained using the training data.

- Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like the confusion matrix and classification report.

- Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on new handwritten digit images.

# Usage
You can use this project as a template for building and evaluating classification models for handwritten digit recognition. The provided code snippets and comments guide you through each step of the process.
